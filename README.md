# notes-on-things

This repository is intended to just be a collection of my notes and findings through just researching different things, topics and sub topics listed later on in this document, and I intend to update it as I research more things. 

I am expecting the Technology section the be the one with the most research, as there are a variety of topics under that that could be covered, including subtopics each with multiple subtopics of their own. I will likely rename this section later on, as that name may be too vague for what I would like.
