# Notes for my ideas about this app


TUI and GUI versions available

Would allow you to create folders and files. 
	You would be able to access these files
		With a tree showing them? Keybind to list in the TUI version, same on GUI but it could also be a panel that shows up instead
			Maybe a panel comes up on both.
				Panel shows a tree like Tree view - except nicer looking - that shows all the files in the folders. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_view)
			
Would allow you to easily reference these files in other files. You would also be able to reference specific lines, and see what is in the file you are referencing. 

Maybe have a reference mode so that it can easily check if a line is a reference or not, if it is then hovering or clicking could show or take you to the referenced file (and line if posible).


Allow lots of customisation in settings, different keybinds modes etc.









Possible uses


-	Could be very useful for design documents for big projects, instead of having hundreds of thousands of lines in a single text document, you could have multiple easily accesible

-	Could be good for multiple people working on something, maybe allow multiple people to have access to a folder. These people would be able to reference what other people did without having to do it in the same document.

-	Can't think of many more uses, but idc, i still like it.
